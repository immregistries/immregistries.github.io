    <h1>Great Books</h1>
    <p>In now particular order, here is my library of great books for personal and work productivity.</p>
    <h2>The How of Happiness</h2>
    <p>
      Provides a research based analysis of what makes people happy. Introduces the idea that about 40% of our happiness (on average) is within our
      own control. <a href="http://amzn.com/0143114956">Amazon</a>)

    <h2>What Got You Here Won't Get You There</h2>
    <p>
      Marshall Goldsmith gives an inside look to his process for advising Fortune 500 clients on what they can do to move forward in their career by
      addressing the one or two issues that are holding them back. The trap we all fall into is believing that our current success is because of all
      the things we do and are, and that we should not mess with what's working. Marshall points the way to identifying and then tackling those habits
      or modes of working that are holding us back. (<a href="http://amzn.com/1401301304">Amazon</a>)

      You need your early-adopting clients/consumers are to talk about your product to the next set of potential clients. Good products that are not
      remarkable will not be talked about. (<a href="http://amzn.com/1591843170">Amazon</a>)
