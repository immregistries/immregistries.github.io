    <h1>HL7 Conference 2012</h1>
    <p>Report on conference</p>
    <h2>Sunday</h2>
    <h3>FHIR Hands-on</h3>

    <p>Grahame Greaves presentation on how to integrate with development of FHIR. FHIR is pronounced "FIRE". Not a class on how to implement. FHIR
      is new and builds upon both HL7 v2 and HL7 v3. My take on this is that FHIR is the next generation after v3. HL7 v3 was built to support
      modelers but was not good for hands one. FHIR is focused on hands on, getting connections accomplished, fast. Highly focused on IMPLEMENTATION.
      This is a standard that might one day replace our HL7 v2 messages. Here is an opportunity for us to become involved on a domain committee to
      represent immunizations.</p>

    <p>Attended orientation meeting and listened to an introduction to the work group and standards development process.</p>
    <h2>Monday</h2>

    <h3>Open Plenary</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Leslie Kelly Hall from Health Wise</b><br /> Talking about patient generated data. Data that is created by and sent by patient's themselves.
      Spoke about the need to "Liberate Patient Data". Listed the following progressive steps: (1) Inform Me (2) Engage Me (3) Empower Me (4) Partner
      with Me.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Lee Rainie from Pew Internet Project</b><br /> Pew Internet Project is a Fact Tank. Talking about new network age in healthcare. Neworked
      Individulism. Social networks are more important than they used to be. (I'm not so sure that they are so different, rather that the networks are
      now more online than they have ever been.) Talking about technology usage by Americans, Internet usage is high, now more smart phones than
      regular cell phones, already 30% of those have at least one health app on their phone. Social networking use is increasing, even among 65+. Half
      of searches for health questions are done on behalf of others. Things are changing a lot, be not afraid! Questions about how people might share
      a lot of information online.
    </p>

    <h3>Panel Discussion</h3>

    <p>
      <b>Chuck Parker from Continua Health Alliance</b><br /> Focused on making guidelines for implementing certification program for sensors that
      can be used to track patients and help them manage their disease with the goal of keeping the patient from going to acute care. HL7 standards
      have been critical to smoothing adoption and integrating these systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Chris Lehmann from Vanderbilt</b><br /> AAP has received a grant to work on developing a model EHR format. They developed a description of
      an ideal pediatric EHR based on HL7 standards and selected home-grown EHR's that demonstrate best practice. Meetings included 11 vendors who
      came to AAP and asked for more guidance on algorithms. Group eventually created web service to communicate and implement Bright Futures.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jim St. Clair from HIMSS</b><br /> Talking about mHiMMS process. Talked about mobile hardware penetration and the future use of health
      applications. Right data, right time, right place.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Lonnie Smith from FDA</b><br /> Talked about Structured Product Labels (SPL). These are statements that are made by manufacturers and send
      to the FDA, which sends them to the National Library of Medicine (NLM) which operates a web site for doctors and consumers to look up drug
      medication. The site is called Daily Med.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Heather Grain from Standards Australia</b><br /> Talked about the view from consumers. Very interesting. Talked about the great variety of
      opinions that consumers have and the need for health care professionals to listen them. Particularly important is that consumers want control
      over their information and how it's shared. Compared changes in the last 10 years:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Afraid of tech --&gt; Already happened</li>
      <li>No idea of benefit --&gt; Long list of benefits</li>
      <li>Strong idea of risks --&gt; Understand risks, feel need to balance</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Spoke about how surprising it is to find that some things that you would think are NOT sensitive are considered highly sensitive to some
      consumers, while highly sensitive issues are considered critical to share by other consumers.</p>

    <p>
      <b>Charles Jaffe</b><br /> Talked a little about board's decision to make large parts of IP open source. Meeting during lunch to talk about
      implication for HL7 as an organization.
    </p>
    <h3>Lunch Meeting about Future of HL7</h3>
    <p>CEO Charles Jaffe lead a discussion to a fairly full room of HL7 members. He explained that August 1st the HL7 board voted to make HL7 IP
      freely available, whereas currently it is available only for HL7 members or for purchase. Charles Jaffe asked what directly should HL7 take in
      order to continue growing the organization. He called first on a member from Kaiser Permamente who indicated that a change that is needed is for
      membership to be offered on a multi-year basis, with yearly payments, in order to help HL7 have more steady funding. He also said that Kaiser
      Permamente indicated a commitment to purchase a multi-year organizational membership. Charles Jaffe went on to say that since the announcement
      and the idea from Kaiser Peramente they have nearly 20 benefactors who have come forward with similar commitments.</p>
    <p>Discussion then turned to several questions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Should HL7 offer tooling software? This is something the board has been asking HL7 to do. Quite a big challange, HL7 is not a software
        organization per se.</li>
      <li>Should HL7 offer consulting services? Currently requests for consulting assistance is referred to HL7 members known to provide this.</li>
      <li>Should HL7 become more like a professional organization with service to HL7 professionals?</li>
      <li>Should HL7 rely more on the conferences for income? Currently conferences are break-even, but perhaps significant income could be
        generated by opening conference to vendors.</li>
      <li>Should HL7 charge higher memberships for government entities? Currently organizations, such as CMS, benefit directly and substantially
        by the work of HL7, but each entity only pays the organizational membership fee of $100. Some comments were made from states and other
        governments about current restrictions that make even paying for attendance at HL7 meetings a large barrier and that more funding is not
        likely.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The underlying fear is that current interest for membership is driven by the need of organizations to receive the specification, if it is
      free then they will no longer pay for membership. HL7 is currently designed and built by volunteers who are willing to pay membership fees. Some
      comments were made that the interest for HL7 will increase tremendously as this goes public and that while we may loose some members we will
      gain many more interested in working on an open project.</p>
    <h3>Workgroup Meeting</h3>
    <p>
      <b>CGIT</b><br />This is the first workgroup I have attended. The work of this group is related to the NIST certification project I worked on
      this summer. The work of the group is critical for moving towards standardized HL7 v2 messages which have been a big issue for IIS and EHR
      integration for the last 10 years.
    </p>

    <h2>Tuesday</h2>
    <h3>Morning Speakers</h3>
    <p>Listened to several small presentations. Covered topics including HL7 freely available IP, Trifolia, Fresh Look, CMI, collaboration with
      SDO's, tooling strategies, FHIR Connectathon, HingX, HL7 Internation Council, and Privacy Pilot.</p>
    <h3>Workgroup Meetings</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Orders and Observations, Joint Meeting</b><br />Attended to understand better what this work group does. Not much cross over with
      immunizations. This is the group the Rob Savage went to ask for adding the OBX directly to the VXU after the PID segment. In this meeting there
      was a long discussion involving something related to Structered Product Label.
    </p>

    <h2>Wednesday</h2>
    <h3>Morning Presentations</h3>
    <p>
      <b>IHIC Conference 2012</b>: Announcement for meeting in Vienna later this month. All invited to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Election Results</b>: Announced the results of recent elections.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Treasurer's Report</b>: Gave report on HL7 organization. HL7 is currently well financed and looks to be growing in the comnig years.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Presentation from Board</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>LOINC &amp; IHTSDO (SONMED) discussed the upcoming integration of LOINC and SNOMED codes. HL7 is anxious to see this completed as it
        will help their work.</li>
      <li>Report on ROI on Mobile Health. Hospitals are quieter with mobile devices, no more paging going on. Doctors like adopting the
        technology. Patients and doctors report high satisfaction</li>
      <li>Talked about the change to allow standards and selected IP to be released to the public for free. Told to be careful of what is said
        because not everything made by HL7 will necessarily be free. They are only talking about the standards produced and other selected IP. HL7 is
        expecting that they will probably reserve certain IP for use by members only.</li>
      <li>They discussed several issues around the need for more standard developers. Looking at expanding face-to-face trainings and on demand
        education. They also want to expand the curricula to include care givers, developers and implementors. Thinking about annual renewable
        certifications for profissionals where they have to demonstrate their current skills. Are looking to start again the Membership Advisory
        Committee. Will be introducing multi-year memberships which already have a lot of support from current organizational members. Considering the
        possibility of giving members early access to IP.</li>
      <li>Talked about growth internationally and in new markets: mobile health, quality, clinical genomics, and patient derived data.</li>
      <li>Gave update on TSC related actions. Looking at defining backwards compatibility for only so many versions back. Looking at strategic
        initiatives and defining product lines.</li>
      <li>On the national and regional level, HL7 has been in touch with the US congress and have been talking about the value of HL7. South
        Africa is in contact with HL7 and HL7 is encouraging them to become an affiliate.</li>
      <li>Looking to make things easier. Expand collaboration with IHE. Use the <a
        href="http://www.lantanagroup.com/newsroom/press-releases/trifolia-workbench/">Trifolia</a> tool.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>Recognitions</b>
    </p>
    <h3>Workgroup Meetings</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Patient Care Workgroup</b>: PHER attended as well, discussed how to model allergies and intolerance conditions. No direct connection to
      immunizations.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Electronic Health Record Workgroup</b>: A joint meeting with PHER, Patient Care, CIC, Patient Safety, and Pharmacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Talking about the <a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=278">Public Health Functional Profile</a> (PHFP).
      This project defines a set of functions that EHR's need to have in order to support public health needs. They showed a list of domains, not one
      of them is specific to immunizations. Might be included under Other PH Domains. Immunization must not have "come to the table yet". <em>[Should
        AIRA be involved?]</em> There are three main profiles that are already finished and published. Interesting in adding domains to their profile. <em>Perhaps
        we should work on an Immunization profile?</em> The long term picture is that if an EHR implements this profile they are going to see their systems
      work well with public health.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Clinical Decision Support Workgroup</b>: Very interesting session. Heard presentations on three different subjects.
    </p>
    <p>Eric Larson reported on activities of the IISB in preparing the logic specification for immunizations. Report is due out October 29.</p>
    <p>Alean Kirnack reported on progress of the Cross-Paradigm Interoperability Implementation Guide for Immunizations project. Found some very
      interesting things. The project as turned into a process of finding the gaps between several different standards. One of the biggest holes is
      that there is no standard for requesting and getting a forecast. Also talked about how the VIS and VFC information is US realm specific.</p>
    <p>Daryl Chertcoff gave a presentation about the process of the Immunization Calculation Engine (ICE) that they are implementing in OpenCDS.
      They are making good progress and expect to have the application out in open source around next April.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conformance and Guidance for Implementation/Testing Work Group</b>: Report from Vocabulary Work Group. They are going through vocabulary in
      versions of HL7. The have gone through all but 220 tables. It has been quite an amazing amount of work. Talking about Binding Syntax.

    <hr/>
    <h2>My Thoughts</h2>
    <p>The changes to the HL7 organization are exciting and offer an opportunity for the HL7 community at large to give input about how HL7
      organization could better help the entire community. I have a few ideas in this area. But before I give my ideas it's important to establish a
      few things first:</p>
    <p>
      <b>Background</b>: HL7 users comes from one of two basic backgrounds: medical &amp; technical. Medical professionals are attracted to HL7 as they
      work to pull systems together, technical professionals as they try to put these medical systems together. HL7 has always had a very technical,
      geeky, background, which I think is its strength. It needs to grow by helping the medical community understand the standards better and to help
      the technical community understand the medical aspects.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Level of Involvement</b>: There are three basic levels of involvement in HL7. The original and most visible is that of the HL7 standards
      development. This level is where the current active members of HL7 operate at. HL7 spends a considerable amount of effort in this area. The
      second level is that of active implementors, and the third is active operators of HL7 interfaces. The size of the operators group is much larger
      than the implementors group, which is itself much larger than the development group.
    </p>
    <p>Here is what HL7 could do to support each of these three groups:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>HL7 Standard Operator</b>: Offer online training and certification of operator level abilities. This training should not take too
        long or cost too much, and should offer two areas of focus, medical and technical. The idea behind the training would be to familiarize the
        student on the HL7 standard and how it can be used to help interoperability. It would also be good to require continuing education, at least
        every 2 or 3 years, to continue to hold certification.</li>
      <li><b>HL7 Standard Implementor</b>: Expand the current education and training so that it includes both an in-person component and a online
        process. The online process should be built to keep implementors up-to-date on latest changes and updates and allow for keeping certification
        current. Certification at this level could be renewed every year or two. Perhaps the initial certification expense is good, but ongoing
        certification should not be too expensive.</li>
      <li><b>HL7 Standard Developer</b>: A developer, who is active in HL7 and contributes, should receive the highest level of certification.
        This person should be actively participating in HL7, mentoring implementers and operators, promoting HL7, training HL7 users, and helping to
        develop standards. Active developers should have reduced costs to be active members as they are producing a great value to the community.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>User Group Meetings</b>: HL7 currently divides development work into a set of volunteer workgroups and is always looking for new members to
      staff these organizations. There is a large untapped resource of Implementors and Operators who currently do not participate in these groups.
      The reasons for this probably range from (1) they don't know about the workgroups and (2) they don't have time to contribute to the process. HL7
      organization is missing a large potential by not engaging this group directly. What would be very useful to this group would be to form a set of
      User Groups built around specific tops that are placed underneath the work groups, and are mentored by the work groups. These user groups could
      simply be regular conference calls that allow users to talk about implementation problems they are encountering and get help from the larger
      group. This type of setup would likely have a large amount of interest and would introduce people to HL7 organization and some of these would
      likely want to eventually help with development.
    </p>

    <p>
      <img src="HL7 Conference 2012 Idea 2.gif" />
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Conferences</b>: These could be improved for implementors by doing the following things:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Have something that introduces the work of all the meetings so that we can all see what they are doing. Perhaps presentations on the
        first day? Or maybe a set of meetings on the first day where all the groups tell a smaller audience about what they do? I would love to see a
        30 minute presentation from each group about what they have accomplished and what they are working on for the next year.</li>
      <li></li>
