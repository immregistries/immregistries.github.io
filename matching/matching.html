    <h1>Matching</h1>
    <p>Patient information comes from multiple sources and needs to be matched with the additional information from a different source.</p>
    <h2>Technical Road Map</h2>
    <img src="Technical Diagram.png" width="700" height="474" border="0" />
    <h3>WIR RunMatch Log Parser</h3>
    <p>This is the code that Eric Larson is working on that summarizes and pulls information from the runmatch logs that the WIR-base states
      create. Eric is looking to see if the Signature process that Rick Hall is putting together can be incorporated into this.</p>
    <h3>Signature Generator</h3>
    <p>This is code that Rick Hall is working on, it will take two potential patient matches and produce a signature that will give the
      characteristics of the data. This can then be used to generate a similar set of matches. This code needs to be standardized so that it can be
      used in all the Extractors to get example data out based on real data but that doesn't have patient identifiable information in it.</p>
    <h3>MCIR Extract</h3>
    <p>Gerry Bragg is working on a process for logging the MCIR matching process. This information can hopefully also be pulled into the project
      using the signature functionality.</p>
    <h3>Test Case Generator</h3>
    <p>Generates test cases using a two methods:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Generates sets of possible patient pairings and then performs iterations of "changes" to introduce typos and other conditions that
        challenge matching. Rick Hall is working on some of this. Nathan Bunker has some code that does this now in the OIS code.</li>
      <li>Generates new patient pairings based on signatures captured "in the wild".</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>User Interface</h3>
    <p>There needs to be some kind of central user interface to allow access to the test cases. There is a lot of potential functions here and
      some of the areas shown in this diagram may or may not be included. We are not creating a real specific line yet on what exactly would be
      created and how it would be integrated. Some pieces might be loosely integrated at first. Some of the major functions include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Allow for entering, reviewing, and setting match status on test cases.</li>
      <li>Support for multiple users and differences on opinion as to the match status.</li>
      <li>Ability to manage test case sets, to merge them together, and pull parts off. Probably want the ability for a test case to exist in
        more than one test case set at a time.</li>
      <li>Ability to export the data in HL7 format, CSV format, and in an XML format that includes extra test case data for import into alternate
        test case systems.</li>
      <li>Integrate with Test Case Generator.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Verification System</h3>
    <p>Now that we have the test cases in a UI, it would be great to be able to submit them against some known matching systems, such as the OIS
      Matcher and the MatchWare Matcher configured to match on the CDC set. Are there other matchers we could integrate with? In addition the UI could
      contain a process to verify a test case set against a matcher to measure the performance. Some of this has already been done in the OIS Matcher.
      The MatchWare one must have a large range of functions that we could integrate with.</p>
    <p>
    <h3>Test Case Database</h3>
    <p>All the test cases would be stored in the MySQL database. This would be the central repository of the work group test cases.</p>
