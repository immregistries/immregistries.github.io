    <h1>Day 2 - 04 April 2012</h1>
    <p>Patient matching is a critical function for immunization registries. Today I worked on creating a plan for writing JUnit tests for the
      small patient matching open source project that I'm working on in collaboration with the Massachusetts Immunization Information System. The MIIS
      technical team will be working on implementing these JUnit tests.</p>
    <h2>CDC Patient Matching Workgroup</h2>
    <p>I am also working with the CDC Patient Matching Workroup. There are several participants who are technically oriented and we are working to
      put together a set of software tools that can be used to tune and improve patient matching systems. We are looking to pull data from several
      projects across the nation. More details will be coming soon about this.</p>
