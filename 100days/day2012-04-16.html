    <h1>Day 5 - 16 April 2012</h1>
    <p>Worked today on converting Registry Tester from NetBeans over to work in Eclipse and Tomcat. I was able to move all the functionality
      directly over except for the TLEP web service support. I will add that back in later once the DQA has web service support added. The old
      NetBeans project will still exist, but I will not be making any more changes and will turn it into a legacy project.</p>
    <p>The Registry Tester is now in the DQA project and will be called the DQA Tester. It will not be tightly integrated with the DQA but will
      tasked with first verifying that the DQA is working correctly and second, profiling other immunization registries as part of the IHS profiling
      project.</p>
    <p>In addition to this conversion I'm upgrading the connection between the DQA and the DQA tester by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Adding an automatic feature in DQA that when it creates a new profile it can export a file with the connection information that can be
        cut and pasted into scripts that the DQA Tester understands. This will make it easy to quickly configure real-time connections to the DQA from
        the DQA Tester.</li>
      <li>Adding support in the DQA to create a single XML document that holds all the settings for a given Template and its associated profile.
        This will allow for porting the template around, once I create an import function in the DQA.</li>
      <li>Added support for saving in the DQA a sample message that can be used to test the application. This sample message is really a script
        that is understood by the DQA Tester and can be used to create an endless number of different test cases.</li>
      <li>Added support in the DQA Tester to read the template XML and run a test against a given connection to verify that it meets the
        template.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I also worked on a new kind of Template, a little different from what MCIR and ImmTrac are doing. I need a template that indicates errors
      if fields that should be supported are not sent. This will be used to verify that the IHS RPMS BYIM changes are being done correctly. This new
      profile is essentially very strict and points out any missing or erroneous values. In practice most systems are not as strict.</p>
    <p>Tomorrow I will be focusing on integrating the whole process, documenting it and creating a process for easily profiling or testing any
      interface. There is a lot of work to do, but this is going to be a great resource for my projects and others in the future.</p>
