    <h1>Road Map</h1>
    <p>Data quality assurance is critical for registries importing data from providers. The OIS Data Quality Assurance (DQA) tool is the result of
      a collaborative effort between several registries. Initial development began in the Spring of 2011 by the Texas immunization registry, ImmTrac,
      with a goal of creating a data quality process to augment their new HL7 interface.</p>

    <h1>Release Notes</h1>
    <h2>Release 1.08 - October 16, 2014</h2>
    <p>This release includes several critical improvements to the functionality of the DQA.</p>
    <h3>Submission Process</h3>
    <p>A new process has been added to support an internal submission queue. This new submission process matches function of the original file
      submission process and allows additional methods of importing data into the DQA. In addition an upload interface has been added to the admin
      menu to allow for uploading into this submission table, and to check on the status of all submissions.</p>
    <h3>Database Cleanup</h3>
    <p>Support has been added for automatic an regular removal of data from the DQA database. This is important as otherwise the amount of data
      stored by the DQA continues to grow as data is inserted. The DQA was built to be able to progressively delete data starting from that which was
      most detailed and continue to provide good information at the aggragate level. The cleanup can be configured and scheduled in the admin menu.</p>
    <h3>IIS Data Quality Support</h3>
    <p>Added initial support for the American Immunization Registry (AIRA) data quality project for IIS. This required adding new validations and
      support for a simplified flat-file format.</p>
    <h3>Patch Release Notes</h3>
    <p>Patch 1.08.02 - October 16, 2014</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed bug with uploading submission files in Internet Explorer.</li>
      <li>Updated documentation of issues to include explanation for new issues added in 1.08.</li>
      <li>Added support for checking submissions to ensure that they contained HL7 data, have a file footer when a file header is given, and can
        (if configured in admin) verify that message control ids are unique within the submission itself.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Release 1.06 - August 20, 2013</h2>
    <p>The following improvements were made:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Potential Issue table now has an hl7_error_code column that holds the numeric HL7 error code that should be used when construct ACK
        messages. This is to assist the requesting system in determining the type of error that was generated.</li>
      <li>Code Master table has been reworked and now supports hierarchies of codes and links observation codes to other code tables. For example
        the concept of a state code being unique within a given country code is now supported (which allows Baja California (BC), Mexico and British
        Columbia (BC), Canada to exist in the same master table.) and allows the DQA to understand that the observation code that identifies the
        vaccination's VFC status is linked to the set of Financial Codes.</li>
      <li>Likewise the Code Received table has been altered to support a context_value that indicates the given context for a code. This allows
        an interface to receive a state code for both Baja California and British Columbia and keep those values received separate. Without this the
        two states would share the same entry in this table.</li>
      <li>Remove a duplicate in the Code Table and added new Code Table concepts.</li>
      <li>Added all Mexico and Canadia states to the master code table list. Add all US counties to the code master table in both SSNNN and NNNNN
        formats.</li>
      <li>Created Vaccination VIS table to hold all VIS information for a single vaccination. While the database holds these values DQA does not
        yet fully support them.</li>
      <li>Added concepts of funding_source, refusal_reason, vis_presented_date, and vis_document_code to Vaccination table. While the database
        holds these values DQA does not yet fully support them.</li>
      <li>Added QBP/RSP interface. This is for supporting testing by the DQA. This interface is functional but not up to standard, as some data
        is not returned and some technical items remain. The next version will finish bringing this up to full compliance with standards.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Release 1.05 - November 14, 2012</h2>

    <p>The largest change in this release was the addition of support for recording the status of remote Simple Message Movers. This change was
      for the deployment and support of IHS installation of the SMM.</p>
    <p>In addition the following bug fixes were made:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed bug with database connection creation not being synchronized.</li>
      <li>Added version to the bottom of DQA report.</li>
      <li>Fixed percentage issues on DQA report.</li>
      <li>Changed validation of facility in RXA-11.4 so that it only happens on administered vaccinations.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Release 1.04 - October 8, 2012</h2>
    <h3>Improved Invalid Validation</h3>
    <p>The largest change in this version is a revision to how CVX, CPT, MVX and vaccine product concepts are validated. Previous to this version
      a code could be invalidated for either being an invalid code outright, or because the vaccination event it was associated with was on a date
      that was outside the expected or required code use dates. This caused some confusion and problems because a single code could be valid in some
      situations and valid in others. This violated the idea common to all codes that a code is either valid or invalid in it's own right. Other
      isssue might be determined but these were not validity per se.</p>
    <p>This release introduces two new flavors of issues:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>is invalid for administered date</b>: An otherwise valid code is invalid because it was used sooner or later than the valid range
        for this code.</li>
      <li><b>is unexpected for administered date</b>: An otherwise expected code is not expected because it was used sooner or later than the
        expected range for this code.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Normally an invalid issue would trigger an error and an unexpected will trigger a warning.</p>
    <p>In relation to historical codes, these new issues would only be triggered or checked for on administered vaccinations. To mark a code as
      invalid for historical, the only method currently available is to mark the code globally invalid in the template code received table. In this
      case this code will not be valid for reporting any vaccination, at any time, either for historical or administered. It is expected that very few
      of these codes will be considered to be outright invalid.</p>
    <h3>Improved Tracking for Vaccine Product</h3>
    <p>Vaccine Product is a derived value from the vaccine administered and the manufacturer indicated. This value is only determined for
      administered vaccinations. Previous to this version, unrecognized combinations were noted with an issue but no other information. This version
      now logs all CVX-MVX combinations as a new code received, as if the sender sent it in the message. This then allows the codes sent to appear on
      the DQA report for troubleshooting.</p>
    <h3>Database Version</h3>
    <p>A new table has been created to track the current database version and logs made during database upgrade. The table has the following
      format:</p>
    <p>Table dqa_database_log:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>change_id</b> unique key to row</li>
      <li><b>change_date</b> date/time change was made locally</li>
      <li><b>change_version</b> the DQA version this change belongs to</li>
      <li><b>change_comment</b> log of change made</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Minor Bug Fixes</h3>
    <p>Also address a few minor issues:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Added period "." as an valid name character.</li>
      <li>Fixed issue with reset profile functionality.</li>
      <li>Added the DQA version to every UI page.</li>
      <li>Added link to profile XML on configuration page.</li>
    </ul>

    </p>
    <h2>Release 1.03 - September 7, 2012</h2>
    <p>This release only a couple of changes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed validation issue with validations being too strict for dates with time components. Added logic to strip time components from most
        date checks.</li>
      <li>Finished automated report for showing errors and warning documention.</li>
    </ul>

    </p>

    <h2>Release 1.02 - August 11, 2012</h2>
    <p>After a two month hiatus to focus on other open source projects the next release of DQA has been finished. This release has the following
      improvements and fixes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The application has been restructured into four major pieces:
        <ul>
          <li><b>Database</b> Defines how to build and populate the persistence layer for three databases: Oracle, MySQL and Hypersonic.</li>
          <li><b>Core</b> Creates a java application jar (module) that encapsulates the core of the DQA logic.</li>
          <li><b>Web Service</b> Exposes the core as a web service that can be accessed by the IIS or other integration system.</li>
          <li><b>Web UI</b> Exposes the core as a web application and builds a Java Servlet war. The result of this project is essentially what
            the DQA was in release 1.1.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>There has been some improvement in the validation:
        <ul>
          <li>Support for not expecting a value in RXA-9 when the completion status indicates that the vaccination was actually not given. This
            will support properly reporting vaccination waivers.</li>
          <li>Added validation for phone numbers. Previously the "invalid" issue was not triggered for badly formatted phone numbers.</li>
          <li>Added warning for indicating that the Next-of-Kin for an under-age patient was a Child.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Update CVX, MVX, CPT and vaccine product tables with the latest changes from the CDC.</li>
      <li>Added support for saving the message hash id in the DQA database.</li>
      <li>Changed DQA Report so that the "Ready for Production" section at the top can be turned on an off and if the total number of messags are
        lower than a certain threshold that section indicates that a "Ready for Production" determination could not be made.</li>
      <li>Added a new ability on the profile settings page to reload the profile settings. This allows for updating the core data and potential
        issue status and then refreshing the profile settings.</li>
      <li>Modified the documentation page so that it will display all issues or just the ones with errors.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Several items have been postponed for the next release:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Change how CVX and CPT codes are processed. Currently the invalid/valid date ranges are not being handled or documented as well as
        needed. The next release the DQA needs to support two concepts of valid, the first is a list of valid values that the IIS allows and the
        second is the general valid dates as specified by the CDC. In addition the CDC only specifies validity for administered vaccines for CVX. Also
        need to add the ability to indicate that CPT is the preferred code so that it is choosen even when CVX is deemed not acceptable.</li>
      <li>Add support for emailing DQA reports. Looking to integrate with a project tracking system.</li>
      <li>Update the DQA based on the latest CDC guide released last week.</li>
      <li>Improve database setup process for the maven build script.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We are also working to install a Bugzilla to handle bug/improvement tracking. We hope to have this installed in the coming week. This
      should help us keep organized going forward.</p>

      <a href="sprint/DQA Sprint Review 2012-08-08.odp">Sprint Review Presentation</a> (Open Office Impress Format)
    </p>
    <p>The next release is planned for the beginning of September.</p>
    <h2>Release 1.1</h2>
    <p>The next release is scheduled for May 1st and will include significant UI improvements supported by a new web service layer.</p>
    <h2>Release 1.0</h2>
    <p>The final release of the initial development effort was released April 3, 2012. It is available to build from the
      /ois-dqa/interface/wicket/branches/v1_00 SVN folder. This release resolves the following issues identified in the previous release 0.12.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Added ability to specify HL7 references on DQA report. Changed MCIR DQA report to include HL7 references.</li>
      <li>Added new administration UI under /config to support basic administration options. Next version will include some more functionality,
        but most administration will be eclipsed by the new web service interface coming in the next version.</li>
      <li>Moved /test logic to the new /config admin UI.</li>
      <li>Moved the informationation logging under /in to the new /config admin UI.</li>
      <li>Update CVX/CPT codes to latest from CDC.</li>
      <li>Fixed issue with MSH-4 not appearing on the DQA report.</li>
      <li>Changed handling of RXA-5 code tables so that if the code table is not recognized, an issue (which by default is a warning) is
        generated but the DQA attempts to read the code as either a CVX or CPT.</li>
      <li>Created new database installation script to replace the incremental versions used prior to v1.0.</li>
    </ul>
