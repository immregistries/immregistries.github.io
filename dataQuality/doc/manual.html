    <h2>Database</h2>
    <p>In DQA v1.00 most of the DQA functionality is hidden unseen in the database structure. A thorough understanding of the DQA database design
      will allow a user to make full use of the functionality. In later versions the DQA will expose the data and control available in the database
      design.</p>
    <p>How to read the following diagrams:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Each table name beings with DQA_ and is followed by the name separated by underscores. The DQA diagram shows the tables names in an
        easier to read format. The table titled "User Account" represents the database table DQA_USER_ACCOUNT.</li>
      <li>The arrows point from a database foreign key to a table that it references.</li>
      <li>Most arrows terminate on the table, but others are separated on different pages. These arrows point to the left or right indicating
        that the object referred to lies on a different page.</li>
      <li>The columns are listed below in their logical order.</li>
      <li>Columns with defined discrete values have them listed in white insets. This is for simplicity in reading the diagram.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>
      <a name="UserAccount"></a>User Account
    </h4>
    <p>Contains a list of users that can access the DQA. Currently only used to authorize the admin user who can access the configuration user
      interface.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>username</b> The username that identifies the DQA user.</li>
      <li><b>password</b> The password (currently in plain text) that can be used to authenticate the DQA user.</li>

    </ul>
    <h4>
      <a name="Organization"></a>Organization
    </h4>
    <p>Represents a single reporting entity. The DQA was not built to model every organizational structure that exists, but rather a simple
      hierarchy that applies for submitting entities. As of version 1.00 this is not depended on for specific logic.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>org_id</b> Unique database id.</li>
      <li><b>org_label</b> Short, human readable description.</li>
      <li><b>org_parent_id</b> Reference to organization this belongs to. The base organization is the immunization registry and this
        organization refers to itself. This field is required.</li>
      <li><b>coded_value</b> This field is no longer used, as it has been replaced by org_local_code. It will be removed in future DQA versions.</li>
      <li><b>primary_profile_id</b> The profile that this organization is associated to by default. The DQA supports assigning more than one
        profile to a single submitting organization but normally an organization will have one profile.</li>
      <li><b>org_local_code</b> The external id for this organization. This would normally be an id assigned by the IIS.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
      <a name="SubmitterProfile"></a>Submitter Profile
    </h4>
    <p>A submitting organization sends data and it is classified under a profile. The profile contains settings, characteristics, status, and
      reports associated with this imported data. Normally an submitting organization would only have one profile, but others would be defined if the
      organization sends data from more than one system or one account is dedicated for testing.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>profile_id</b> Unique database id. When submitting realtime this is indicated using FACILITY_ID field.
        <ul>
          <li><b>1..100</b> Reserved for MASTER submitter profiles. Master profiles are templates that are recognized by DQA.</li>
          <li><b>101..250</b> Reserved for TEST submitter profiles, used by DQA centrally for software quality testing.</li>
          <li><b>251..1199</b> Reserved for pre-defined templates defined by DQA centrally.</li>
          <li><b>1200..</b> Open for all profiles defined by local DQA instance.</li>
        </ul></li>
      <li><b>profile_code</b> Unique code for profile assigned by the IIS. This is an external value and is an alternate key for this profile.</li>
      <li><b>profile_label</b> Short, human readable description.</li>
      <li><b>profile_status</b> Indicates how this profile should be handled.
        <ul>
          <li><b>Setup</b> Profile has been created but not configured, currently not used by DQA. Will be used when UI is in place and user has
            begun process to define the profile but has not yet finished.</li>
          <li><b>Test</b> Profile has been configured and is ready to receive messages, but the data has not been approved to move towards
            production.</li>
          <li><b>Prod</b> Profile is approved by IIS to go to production. Data received will be sent to the IIS.</li>
          <li><b>Hold</b> Profile has been temporarily stopped so data does not move into production.</li>
          <li><b>Closed</b> Profile is no longer active, can not receive data, and does not participate in reporting activities.</li>
          <li><b>Template</b> Profile is not used for regular submissions, but rather serves as a template for new submission profiles.</li>
        </ul></li>
      <li><b>org_id</b> Organization this submission profile is assigned under.</li>
      <li><b>data_format</b> The format of the data being accepted. In version 1.00 the DQA only supported HL7 version 2 messages.
        <ul>
          <li><b>HL7v2</b> Health Level Seven version 2.x messages.</li>
        </ul></li>
      <li><b>transfer_priority</b> Indicates the level of quality and status for processing. Higher priority messages may be processed sooner.
        Can be used to prioritize export batches.
        <ul>
          <li><b>Normal</b></li>
          <li><b>High</b></li>
          <li><b>Highest</b></li>
          <li><b>Low</b></li>
          <li><b>Lowest</b></li>
        </ul></li>
      <li><b>access_key</b> Auto generated code that is the "password" for this profile and should be sent in the PASSWORD field on the real time
        interface.</li>
      <li><b>template_id</b> References report template that should be used when generating DQA reports for this profile.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
      <a name="PotentialIssueStatus"></a>Potential Issue Status
    </h4>
    <p>Indicates the specific status for a given profile and potential issue. This table allows for setting the error/warning/accept/skip status
      for a specific issue for a specific profile. When creating a new profile the DQA populates this table based on the defaults defined by the base
      profile associated with the report template. In version 1.00 there is no UI to change potential issue status, but changing it in the database
      will affect the specific profile.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>potential_issue_status_id</b> Unique database id.</li>
      <li><b>issue_id</b> References potential issue.</li>
      <li><b>profile_id</b> References submitter profile.</li>
      <li><b>action_code</b> Indicates the type of action that the DQA should take when an issue is encountered.</li>
      <li><b>expect_min</b> Indicates the minimum percentage that this issue is expected to occur. Value is an integer valued from 0 to 100. The
        DQA does not currently act on this value.</li>
      <li><b>expect_max</b> Indicates the maximum percentage that this issue is expected to occur. Value is an integer valued from 0 to 100. The
        DQA does not currently act on this value.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
      <a name="Application"></a>Application
    </h4>
    <p>Represents different installed versions of the DQA. While only one application can run at a time, this allows for dynamically reconfiguring
      DQA to run as any available application.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>application_id</b> Unique database id.</li>
      <li><b>application_label</b> Short, human readable description.</li>
      <li><b>application_type</b> A modifier of the application label to indicate a specific use for this application, such as Test or Prod.</li>
      <li><b>run_this</b> Indicates whether this is the currently selected application.
        <ul>
          <li><b>Y</b> Only one record should be marked as Yes.</li>
          <li><b>N</b> All other records should be marked as No.</li>
        </ul></li>
      <li><b>primary_template_id</b> Indicates the report template that should be used by default by the DQA. This is used in situations where
        the DQA automatically creates a submitter profile, such as when reading FTP folders. In future versions of the DQA, the user will select the
        template from a list of available templates when creating a new profile.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
      <a name="ReportTemplate"></a>Report Template
    </h4>
    <p>Represents the settings for a DQA report that may be run on a submitting profile. For version 1.00 most applications will run only one type
      of DQA report for all import profiles. In the future, when many different kinds of interfaces are developed, DQA reports may be created to
      represent the characteristics expected for particular sets of interfaces. (For example, the DQA report template for a birthing hospital may be
      different than one for a family practice.)</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>template_id</b> Unique database id.</li>
      <li><b>template_label</b> Short, human readable description.</li>
      <li><b>report_type_id</b> Indicates which broad cross-application category this report belongs to.</li>
      <li><b>report_definition</b> An XML document that describes the structure and weights of the DQA report.</li>
      <li><b>base_profile_id</b></li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
      <a name="IssueAction"></a>Issue Action
    </h4>
    <p>Represents the type of actions that can be taken for a given issue.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>action_code</b> Unique code for action
        <ul>
          <li><b>E</b> Error issue indicates that the message should be rejected. Message will be rejected if at least one error issue is
            identified.</li>
          <li><b>W</b> Warning issue indicates that there is a condition in the message that should be reviewed as a possible problem. Warnings
            do not cuase messages to be rejected.</li>
          <li><b>A</b> Accept issue indicates that the issue is expected and acceptable, they are not highlighted or mentioned.</li>
          <li><b>S</b> Skip issue indicates that the issue should remove a message, or part of a message from processing. For example, if the
            patient is over the age accepted by the IIS, a skip could be used to not process over-aged patients and their vaccinations and still not
            generate an error. A skip may also be used at the vaccination level to indicate that a specific vaccination should not be processed. For
            example, a known non-immunization even could be quietly skipped using this action.</li>
        </ul></li>
      <li><b>action_label</b> Short, human readable description</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
      <a name="PotentialIssue"></a>Potential Issue
    </h4>
    <p>Represents the total set of possible issues that the DQA is sensitive to. In version 1.00 not all issues have been implemented. The most
      important and crucial issues are implemented, the other were not because (1) implementation requires a large amount of effort or (2) the issue
      is a low priority issue. Eventually all issues will be implemented as improvements are made.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>issue_id</b> Unique id.</li>
      <li><b>target_object</b> The base object that the issue is associated with. For example: Patient, Vaccination</li>
      <li><b>target_field</b> The field within the base object. For example: Name First, Admin Code</li>
      <li><b>issue_type</b> The type of issue given a certain field. For example: is missing, is invalid, is valued as</li>
      <li><b>field_value</b> The value of the field, used for certain specific value checks. For example: A, D</li>
      <li><b>default_action_code</b> The default action to take. The use of this field has effectively been replaced by the action_code indicated
        in the potential_issue_satus field.</li>
      <li><b>change_priority</b> Indicates the level of importance for the user to change this issue. Some issues can not be adjusted by the
        user, for example if an HL7 message is missing the PID segment, where the patient id and demographics are, the DQA has to indicate an error as
        it can not be processed. These issues can not be adjusted. Others are often adjusted, for example some sites may be required to always send
        VFC information and others not. Other issues are rarely adjusted. This status indicates the likely hood that an issue will need to be
        addressed so that the UI can put the most important configuration issues on top.
        <ul>
          <li><b>Must</b> This issue needs to be adjusted during the profile creation process to ensure that the issue is set correctly.</li>
          <li><b>Should</b> This issue should be adjusted during the profile creation process, or later when reviewed.</li>
          <li><b>Can</b> This issue may be changed, but normally would not be reviewed.</li>
          <li><b>May</b> This issue may be changed, but would not be normally displayed in the normal process of editing a profile.</li>
          <li><b>Blocked</b> This issue may never be changed.</li>
        </ul></li>
      <li><b>report_denominator</b> The virtual object that this issue is triggered for. Some issues are triggered for every message/patient,
        others are triggered for every vaccination or every administered vaccination. This value allows the DQA report to give a realistic percentage
        for this issue.</li>
      <li><b>issue_description</b> The human readable description for this issue. Not currently well populated. The display text for the issue is
        always the concatenation of target_object, target_field, issue_type, and field_value (with the appropriate spaces between). This display text
        is both controlled and human readable. This is why this field has not been used much yet. In the future this field will probably be filled in
        with more detail.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
      <a name="ReportType"></a>Report Type
    </h4>
    <p>Represents the general category for this report. This is so reports from different applications can be grouped in similar categories. These
      categories are expected to grow as the DQA is used to test different kinds of data sources.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>report_type_id</b> Unique id.</li>
      <li><b>report_type_label</b> Human readable description.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
      <a name="ReportVaccineGroup"></a>Report Vaccine Group
    </h4>
    <p>Represents a vaccine group that may appear on the DQA report. In version 1.0 this is not used, but in the future this will be used to
      indicate for this template what vaccinations are expected to be administered. This will allow for creating a list of vaccinations that are
      expected to be seen from a particular submitter. At this point the DQA report XML defines the vaccine groups globally as DQA users are currently
      not making profile-by-profile changes.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>report_vaccine_group_id</b> Unique database generated id.</li>
      <li><b>group_id</b> References vaccine group.</li>
      <li><b>profile_id</b> References associated profile.</li>
      <li><b>group_status</b> Indicates how a vaccination in this group should be classified.
        <ul>
          <li><b>Expected</b> The vaccination is expected to show up at once in a given batch, every time. For example: DTap</li>
          <li><b>Recommended</b> The vaccination should show up at once in a given batch, but may not always be present.</li>
          <li><b>Optional</b> The vaccination is sometimes given, but may or may not be submitted. For example: Zoster</li>
          <li><b>Not Expected</b> The vaccination is specifically not expected to be sent. For example: Anthrax</li>
        </ul></li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
      <a name="KeyedSetting"></a>Keyed Setting
    </h4>
    <p>Represents a specific setting tied to a key and an object. This is used for cascading settings. If no value is set then the application
      will pick a default.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>keyed_id</b> Unique database assigned id.</li>
      <li><b>keyed_code</b> Unique that identifies the specific setting. This is unique for given object_code and object_id.</li>
      <li><b>object_code</b> The type of object this setting is associated with. The base object is 'Application'.</li>
      <li><b>object_id</b> The id of the object. For an 'Application' object_code the id is the application_id.</li>
      <li><b>keyed_value</b> The value that this setting has.</li>
    </ul>
