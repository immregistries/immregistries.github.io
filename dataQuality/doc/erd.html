    <p>
      The latest version of the database ERD can be found here: <a
        href="https://svn.code.sf.net/p/ois-dqa/code/database/erd/ERD%20v1.08.pdf">ERD v1.08.pdf</a>
    </p>
    <p>Complete documentation of all fields needs to be rewritten. Until then the documentation for ERD v1.00 covers
      nearly 90% of the current database and gives a good grounding in the basic thoughts behind the layout of the
      database.</p>
    <h2>Database ERD v1.00</h2>
    <p>In DQA v1.00 most of the DQA functionality is hidden unseen in the database structure. A thorough
      understanding of the DQA database design will allow a user to make full use of the functionality. In later
      versions the DQA will expose the data and control available in the database design.</p>

    <h3>ERD Diagrams</h3>
    <p>How to read the following diagrams:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Each table name beings with DQA_ and is followed by the name separated by underscores. The DQA diagram
        shows the tables names in an easier to read format. The table titled "User Account" represents the database
        table DQA_USER_ACCOUNT.</li>
      <li>The arrows point from a database foreign key to a table that it references.</li>
      <li>Most arrows terminate on the table, but others are separated on different pages. These arrows point to
        the left or right indicating that the object referred to lies on a different page.</li>
      <li>The columns are listed below in their logical order.</li>
      <li>Columns with defined discrete values have them listed in white insets. This is for simplicity in reading
        the diagram.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>
      <a name="Organization"></a>Organization
    </h4>
    <p>Represents a single reporting entity. The DQA was not built to model every organizational structure that
      exists, but rather a simple hierarchy that applies for submitting entities. As of version 1.00 this is not
      depended on for specific logic.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>org_id</b> Unique id, managed by database. Oracle uses <code>SEQUENCE

        removed in future DQA versions.</li>
      <li><b>primary_profile_id</b> The <a href="#SubmitterProfile">submitter profile</a> that this organization is
        associated to by default. The DQA supports assigning more than one profile to a single submitting organization
        but normally an organization will have one profile.</li>
      <li><b>org_local_code</b> The external id for this organization. This would normally be an id assigned by the
        IIS.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
      <a name="SubmitterProfile"></a>Submitter Profile
    </h4>
    <p>A submitting organization sends data and it is classified under a profile. The profile contains settings,
      characteristics, status, and reports associated with this imported data. Normally an submitting organization would
      only have one profile, but others would be defined if the organization sends data from more than one system or one
      account is dedicated for testing.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>profile_id</b> Unique id, managed by database. Oracle uses <code>SEQUENCE
          dqa_profile_id_sequence INCREMENT BY 1 START WITH 1200</code> <br />When submitting realtime this is indicated using
        FACILITY_ID field.
        <ul>
          <li><b>1..100</b> Reserved for MASTER submitter profiles. Master profiles are templates that are
            recognized by DQA.</li>

            testing.</li>
          <li><b>251..1199</b> Reserved for pre-defined templates defined by DQA centrally.</li>
          <li><b>1200..</b> Open for all profiles defined by local DQA instance.</li>
        </ul></li>
      <li><b>profile_code</b> Unique code for profile assigned by the IIS. This is an external value and is an
        alternate key for this profile.</li>
      <li><b>profile_label</b> Short, human readable description.</li>
      <li><b>profile_status</b> Indicates how this profile should be handled.
        <ul>
          <li><b>Setup</b> Profile has been created but not configured, currently not used by DQA. Will be used
            when UI is in place and user has begun process to define the profile but has not yet finished.</li>
          <li><b>Test</b> Profile has been configured and is ready to receive messages, but the data has not been
            approved to move towards production.</li>
          <li><b>Prod</b> Profile is approved by IIS to go to production. Data received will be sent to the IIS.</li>
          <li><b>Hold</b> Profile has been temporarily stopped so data does not move into production.</li>
          <li><b>Closed</b> Profile is no longer active, can not receive data, and does not participate in
            reporting activities.</li>
          <li><b>Template</b> Profile is not used for regular submissions, but rather serves as a template for new
            submission profiles.</li>
        </ul></li>
      <li><b>org_id</b> Indicates <a href="#Organization">organization</a> that this submission profile is assigned
        under.</li>
      <li><b>data_format</b> The format of the data being accepted. In version 1.00 the DQA only supported HL7
        version 2 messages.
        <ul>
          <li><b>HL7v2</b> Health Level Seven version 2.x messages.</li>
        </ul></li>
      <li><b>transfer_priority</b> Indicates the level of quality and status for processing. Higher priority
        messages may be processed sooner. Can be used to prioritize export batches.
        <ul>
          <li><b>Normal</b></li>

        PASSWORD field on the real time interface.</li>
      <li><b>template_id</b> References report template that should be used when generating DQA reports for this
        profile.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
      <a name="PotentialIssueStatus"></a>Potential Issue Status
    </h4>
    <p>Indicates the specific status for a given profile and potential issue. This table allows for setting the
      error/warning/accept/skip status for a specific issue for a specific profile. When creating a new profile the DQA
      populates this table based on the defaults defined by the base profile associated with the report template. In
      version 1.00 there is no UI to change potential issue status, but changing it in the database will affect the
      specific profile.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>potential_issue_status_id</b> Unique id, managed by database. Oracle uses <code>SEQUENCE
          dqa_potential_status_id_seq INCREMENT BY 1 START WITH 1</code></li>
      <li><b>issue_id</b> References <a href="#PotentialIssue">potential issue</a>.</li>
      <li><b>profile_id</b> References <a href="#SubmitterProfile">submitter profile</a>.</li>
      <li><b>action_code</b> Indicates the type of action that the DQA should take when an issue is encountered.</li>
      <li><b>expect_min</b> Indicates the minimum percentage that this issue is expected to occur. Value is an
        integer valued from 0 to 100. The DQA does not currently act on this value.</li>
      <li><b>expect_max</b> Indicates the maximum percentage that this issue is expected to occur. Value is an
        integer valued from 0 to 100. The DQA does not currently act on this value.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
      <a name="Application"></a>Application
    </h4>
    <p>Represents different installed versions of the DQA. While only one application can run at a time, this allows
      for dynamically reconfiguring DQA to run as any available application.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>application_id</b> Unique id, managed externally in ERD spreadsheet.</li>
      <li><b>application_label</b> Short, human readable description.</li>
      <li><b>application_type</b> A modifier of the application label to indicate a specific use for this
        application, such as Test or Prod.</li>
      <li><b>run_this</b> Indicates whether this is the currently selected application.
        <ul>
          <li><b>Y</b> Only one record should be marked as Yes.</li>
          <li><b>N</b> All other records should be marked as No.</li>
        </ul></li>
      <li><b>primary_template_id</b> Indicates the report template that should be used by default by the DQA. This
        is used in situations where the DQA automatically creates a submitter profile, such as when reading FTP folders.
        In future versions of the DQA, the user will select the template from a list of available templates when
        creating a new profile.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
      <a name="ReportTemplate"></a>Report Template
    </h4>
    <p>Represents the settings for a DQA report that may be run on a submitting profile. For version 1.00 most
      applications will run only one type of DQA report for all import profiles. In the future, when many different
      kinds of interfaces are developed, DQA reports may be created to represent the characteristics expected for
      particular sets of interfaces. (For example, the DQA report template for a birthing hospital may be different than
      one for a family practice.)</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>template_id</b> Unique id, managed by database. Oracle uses <code>SEQUENCE
          dqa_template_id_sequence INCREMENT BY 1 START WITH 1200</code></li>
      <li><b>template_label</b> Short, human readable description.</li>
      <li><b>report_type_id</b> Indicates which broad cross-application category this report belongs to.</li>
      <li><b>report_definition</b> An XML document that describes the structure and weights of the DQA report.</li>
      <li><b>base_profile_id</b> References <a href="#SubmitterProfile">submitter profile</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
      <a name="IssueAction"></a>Issue Action
    </h4>
    <p>Represents the type of actions that can be taken for a given issue.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>action_code</b> Unique id, managed externally in ERD spreadsheet.
        <ul>
          <li><b>E</b> Error issue indicates that the message should be rejected. Message will be rejected if at
            least one error issue is identified.</li>
          <li><b>W</b> Warning issue indicates that there is a condition in the message that should be reviewed as
            a possible problem. Warnings do not cuase messages to be rejected.</li>
          <li><b>A</b> Accept issue indicates that the issue is expected and acceptable, they are not highlighted
            or mentioned.</li>
          <li><b>S</b> Skip issue indicates that the issue should remove a message, or part of a message from
            processing. For example, if the patient is over the age accepted by the IIS, a skip could be used to not
            process over-aged patients and their vaccinations and still not generate an error. A skip may also be used
            at the vaccination level to indicate that a specific vaccination should not be processed. For example, a
            known non-immunization even could be quietly skipped using this action.</li>
        </ul></li>
      <li><b>action_label</b> Short, human readable description</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
      <a name="PotentialIssue"></a>Potential Issue
    </h4>
    <p>Represents the total set of possible issues that the DQA is sensitive to. In version 1.00 not all issues have
      been implemented. The most important and crucial issues are implemented, the other were not because (1)
      implementation requires a large amount of effort or (2) the issue is a low priority issue. Eventually all issues
      will be implemented as improvements are made.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>issue_id</b> Unique id, managed externally in ERD spreadsheet.</li>
      <li><b>target_object</b> The base object that the issue is associated with. For example: Patient, Vaccination</li>
      <li><b>target_field</b> The field within the base object. For example: Name First, Admin Code</li>
      <li><b>issue_type</b> The type of issue given a certain field. For example: is missing, is invalid, is valued
        as</li>
      <li><b>field_value</b> The value of the field, used for certain specific value checks. For example: A, D</li>
      <li><b>default_action_code</b> The default action to take. The use of this field has effectively been
        replaced by the action_code indicated in the potential_issue_satus field. References <a href="#IssueAction">issue
          action</a>.</li>
      <li><b>change_priority</b> Indicates the level of importance for the user to change this issue. Some issues
        can not be adjusted by the user, for example if an HL7 message is missing the PID segment, where the patient id
        and demographics are, the DQA has to indicate an error as it can not be processed. These issues can not be
        adjusted. Others are often adjusted, for example some sites may be required to always send VFC information and
        others not. Other issues are rarely adjusted. This status indicates the likely hood that an issue will need to
        be addressed so that the UI can put the most important configuration issues on top.
        <ul>
          <li><b>Must</b> This issue needs to be adjusted during the profile creation process to ensure that the
            issue is set correctly.</li>
          <li><b>Should</b> This issue should be adjusted during the profile creation process, or later when
            reviewed.</li>
          <li><b>Can</b> This issue may be changed, but normally would not be reviewed.</li>
          <li><b>May</b> This issue may be changed, but would not be normally displayed in the normal process of
            editing a profile.</li>
          <li><b>Blocked</b> This issue may never be changed.</li>
        </ul></li>
      <li><b>report_denominator</b> The virtual object that this issue is triggered for. Some issues are triggered
        for every message/patient, others are triggered for every vaccination or every administered vaccination. This
        value allows the DQA report to give a realistic percentage for this issue.</li>
      <li><b>issue_description</b> The human readable description for this issue. Not currently well populated. The
        display text for the issue is always the concatenation of target_object, target_field, issue_type, and
        field_value (with the appropriate spaces between). This display text is both controlled and human readable. This
        is why this field has not been used much yet. In the future this field will probably be filled in with more
        detail.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
      <a name="ReportType"></a>Report Type
    </h4>
    <p>Represents the general category for this report. This is so reports from different applications can be
      grouped in similar categories. These categories are expected to grow as the DQA is used to test different kinds of
      data sources.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>report_type_id</b> Unique id, managed externally in ERD spreadsheet.</li>
      <li><b>report_type_label</b> Human readable description.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
      <a name="DatabaseLog"></a>Database Log
    </h4>
    <p>Represents comments that were made during upgrades to the DQA database. This can be used to track changes
      made and also to determine the current version of the database. The latest updated row, with the largest change id
      is the one considered to indicate the current version of the database.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>change_id</b> unique key to row</li>
      <li><b>change_date</b> date/time change was made locally</li>
      <li><b>change_version</b> the DQA version this change belongs to</li>
      <li><b>change_comment</b> log of change made</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
      <a name="ReportVaccineGroup"></a>Report Vaccine Group
    </h4>
    <p>Represents a vaccine group that may appear on the DQA report. In version 1.0 this is not used, but in the
      future this will be used to indicate for this template what vaccinations are expected to be administered. This
      will allow for creating a list of vaccinations that are expected to be seen from a particular submitter. At this
      point the DQA report XML defines the vaccine groups globally as DQA users are currently not making
      profile-by-profile changes.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>report_vaccine_group_id</b> Unique id, managed by database. Oracle uses <code>SEQUENCE
          dqa_report_vac_group_id_seq INCREMENT BY 1 START WITH 1</code></li>
      <li><b>group_id</b> References vaccine group.</li>
      <li><b>profile_id</b> References <a href="#SubmitterProfile">submitter profile</a>.</li>
      <li><b>group_status</b> Indicates how a vaccination in this group should be classified.
        <ul>
          <li><b>Expected</b> The vaccination is expected to show up at once in a given batch, every time. For
            example: DTap</li>
          <li><b>Recommended</b> The vaccination should show up at once in a given batch, but may not always be
            present.</li>
          <li><b>Optional</b> The vaccination is sometimes given, but may or may not be submitted. For example:
            Zoster</li>
          <li><b>Not Expected</b> The vaccination is specifically not expected to be sent. For example: Anthrax</li>
        </ul></li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
      <a name="KeyedSetting"></a>Keyed Setting
    </h4>
    <p>Represents a specific setting tied to a key and an object. This is used for cascading settings. If no value
      is set then the application will pick a default.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>keyed_id</b> Unique id, managed by database. Oracle uses <code>SEQUENCE dqa_keyed_id_sequence
          INCREMENT BY 1 START WITH 1</code></li>
      <li><b>keyed_code</b> Unique that identifies the specific setting. This is unique for given object_code and
        object_id.</li>
      <li><b>object_code</b> The type of object this setting is associated with. The base object is 'Application'.</li>
      <li><b>object_id</b> The id of the object. For an 'Application' object_code the id is the application_id.</li>
      <li><b>keyed_value</b> The value that this setting has.</li>

    <p>
      Represents a summary of vaccinations identified and resolved to a known CVX code. This differs from Batch Code
      Received in that a submission that includes CPT and not CVX will still be reprsented here in this table. The DQA
      validation process resolves the codes sent to a single CVX code which is the source of counts here. In this way
      this table may be used to tally the concepts received without regard to the actual code set used. To see counts of
      what was actually received see the <a href="#BatchCodeReceived">Batch Code Received</a> table.

    <p>Represents the patient data received. Special notice should be given that this table is similar to a Patient
      table that may be found within an IIS, but should not be thought of as serving the same purpose. The key
      difference is that this table can have null or empty values where normally the IIS would not and that there is no
      attempt to merge duplicate patient information. For example a patient record may have no name and still be listed
      here, and if the patient is submitted more than once that information will be entered in different rows of this
      table. This is because this table does not represent a consolidated patient record but rather the record that was
      received by the DQA at one time. For this reason this table puts very little constraint about what data is
      populated and allows for a wide range of valid and no-valid values.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Expected</b> The vaccination is expected to show up at once in a given batch, every time. For
            example: DTap</li>
          <li><b>Recommended</b> The vaccination should show up at once in a given batch, but may not always be
            present.</li>
          <li><b>Optional</b> The vaccination is sometimes given, but may or may not be submitted. For example:
            Zoster</li>

        (Note: this month indicates that administering a vaccination after this date is unexpected and invalid and most
        likely repesents a data quality issue. Do not use the ACIP recommendations for healthy children as the sole
        criteria as their are cases with some vaccinations were high-risk children are given vaccinations beyond the
        normal time envelope. These dates are to catch uses that are most positively not correct. Finer validation,
