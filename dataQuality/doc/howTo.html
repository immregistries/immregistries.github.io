    <h1>How To</h1>

    <h2>Manually Remove Data From Database</h2>
    <p>The DQA is an analysis tool and as such collects a great deal of information. Care must be taken to ensure
      that data that is no longer needed is removed. DQA v1.08 includes new functionality to automatically delete old
      data every week. The DQA supports several standard cleanup processes, which are documented here for those who wish
      to run the process manually using more efficient database scripts.</p>
    <h3>Data Fields</h3>
    <p>
      For every
      <code>Message Received</code>
      where the
      <code>Received Date</code>
      is older than the target date for deletion do the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Delete every associated <code>Next Of Kin</code></li>
      <li>Delete every associated <code>Vaccinaton</code>
        <ul>
          <li>Delete every associated <code>Vaccination VIS</code></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Delete every associated <code>Patient</code>
        <ul>
          <li>Delete every associated <code>Patient Id Number</code></li>
          <li>Delete every associated <code>Patient Phone</code></li>
          <li>Delete every associated <code>Patient Address</code></li>
          <li>Delete every associated <code>Patient Immunity</code></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Message Text</h3>
    <p>
      For every
      <code>Message Received</code>
      where the
      <code>Received Date</code>
      is older than the target date for deletion set the
      <code>Request Text</code>
      and
      <code>Response Text</code>
      to null.
    </p>
    <h3>Message Analysis</h3>
    <p>
      For every
      <code>Message Received</code>
      where the
      <code>Received Date</code>
      is older than the target date for deletion do the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Delete all associated <code>Issue Found</code></li>
      <li>Delete all associated <code>Receive Queue</code></li>
      <li>Delete <code>Message Received</code></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Submitted Batch Reports</h3>
    <p>
      For all
      <code>Message Batch</code>
      where the
      <code>End Date</code>
      is before the target date and where the
      <code>Batch Type</code>
      is S for Submission :
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Delete all associated <code>Receive Queue</code></li>
      <li>Delete all associated <code>Batch Issues</code></li>
      <li>Delete all associated <code>Batch Code Received</code></li>
      <li>Delete all associated <code>Batch Actions</code></li>
      <li>Delete all associated <code>Batch Vaccine CVX</code></li>
      <li>Delete all associated <code>Batch Report</code></li>
      <li>Delete <code>Message Batch</code></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Weekly Batch Reports</h3>
    <p>Same as Submission batch except for weekly reports.</p>
    <h3>Submissions</h3>
    <p>
      Delete all
      <code>Submission Analysis</code>
      and
      <code>Submission</code>
      where the
      <code>Submission Status Date</code>
      is before the target date.
    </p>

    <h2>Update Template Profile</h2>
    <p>Every application has a default Report Template that points to a base submitter profile which defines the
      defaults that are used when automatically creating a profile. For the DQA version 1.0 this is the primary way of
      configuring the DQA report for all the profiles. In future versions this process will become more fine-tuned to
      support different types of submitters.</p>
    <h3>How to Update Potential Issue Status for Template</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Check out the the current <a
        href="https://ois-dqa.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ois-dqa/database/ERD - Potential Issue v1.07.ods">ERD -
          Potential Issue spreadsheet</a> from SVN and open in Open Office.
      </li>
      <li>If working on a new version, re-save with the version number this is targeted for. Potential issues
        should not be added to previous versions, only to new versions yet to be finished.</li>
      <li>Select 'Potential Issue' tab, navigate to columns G through I, and locate your systems default action
        code column.</li>
      <li>Update that column's issues to reflect the correct issue status.</li>
      <li>The SQL for inserting the values is listed in columns AH through AM. There are two basic profiles for
        each entity, one for reporting immunizations in general and one for reporting inventory data. (For the time
        being we are only interested in the reporting immunizations settings as this is the default used by DQA.) Make
        sure the database type is listed as 'Oracle' in cell AG2. This indicates to the formulas to make an Oracle
        version of the scripts.</li>
      <li>Copy out both columns for entity you are updating and place in script file.</li>
      <li>In script file add an initial line that deletes all the values from the dqa_potential_issue_status table.
        DELETE FROM dqa_potential_issue_status; This will remove all the potential issue status settings on all profiles
        in the entire project. (This will erase all customized settings for each profile but this should have no impact
        since no one is currently tweaking the potential issue status for each individual profile.) It is possible to
        only delete the potential issue status for just the profile we are inserting but any profile that has already
        imported data will continue to use the old settings unless you force it to refresh from the parent template by
        deleting its statuses. Deleting the whole table forces this refresh on all profiles.</li>
      <li>Run script.</li>
      <li>Restart project.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Test and Verify DQA Validation</h2>
    <p>Once the issues are set properly it's critical to verify that the DQA is working as expected. The DQA
      supports external testing using a separate open source tool, Immunization Registry Tester.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><a href="../../interfacing/immunizationRegistryTester.html">Install the Immunization Registry Tester</a>
        locally or get a test account on the centrally hosted server.</li>
      <li>Setup connect to the system you are testing.</li>
      <li>Setup a test message that does not fail or generate warning messages.</li>
      <li>Run profile on test system.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Clean Submitted Data for Testing</h2>
    <p>During testing it is sometimes necessary to remove all the data that was previously submitted and start back
      from scratch. Depending on the database doing this is quite simple:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Oracle</b> Run the clean.sql. This deletes all the imported data, messages received, and batches
        received values. Do not run this in production or you will loose all of your data.</li>
      <li><b>MySQL</b> Simply delete the datbase and run the scripts again. A handy batch file clean-db.sql will
        run the scripts and do this. If you are not running on Windows, read the script and follow the steps manually or
        create a shell script.</li>
      <li><b>Hypersonic</b> Simply update the database with the latest from the repository, overwriting what you
        have locally.</li>
    </ul>
