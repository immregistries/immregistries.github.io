    <h1>Installation for MySQL</h1>

    <p>The DQA is designed to be most easily installed on MySQL. Installations on other databases such as Oracle and PostGres are supported and
      can be accomplished by a technical team. These instructions are only for those installing the simpliest version on an MySQL database.</p>

    <p>Please Note: These instructions assume that you are generally comfortable with installing your own software, have some experience working
      with databases, and have admnistrative rights to your system. If one or both of these do not apply you will want to ask for assistance from
      other team members or your information systems department to help you with this process.</p>

    <h2>Install MySQL</h2>
    <p>MySQL is available as a free community download. This will work well for local and small installations. (Please note that these directions
      are subject to change. MySQL may change their download and installation process at any time with no notice to this project. )</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Navigate to <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">http://www.mysql.com/</a>.
      </li>
      <li>Select Downloads.</li>
      <li>Scroll to the bottom section titled "MySQL Community Edition (GPL)" and select Community (GPL) Downloads.</li>
      <li>Select Download under the MySQL Community Server section.</li>
      <li>Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For more information or help with MySQL downloads, please follow the links and help documents given on the MySQL page. Installation of
      MySQL is straightforward and standard/default options should be selected.</p>
    <p>Once MySQL is installed you will need to decide on which type of client to use to access it for administrative purposes. Here are your
      choices:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the already installed client that MySQL provides: <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/mysql.html">MySQL
          Command-Line Tool</a>. If you are comfortable with command line tools you will find this easy to use. The directions in the next section will
        assume you are using this tool.
      </li>
      <li>Find your own third party client. A good list of them can be found here: <a
        href="http://www.databasejournal.com/features/mysql/article.php/3880961/Top-10-MySQL-GUI-Tools.htm">Top 10 MySQL GUI Tools</a>.
      </li>
      <li>Use your own client you are familar with. You may already have a database software you use now that can connect to MySQL.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once you have MySQL installed you should ensure the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>MySQL should be running in the background. In Windows MySQL will be installed as a Service. Open your Services panel (<a
        href="http://www.sophos.com/en-us/support/knowledgebase/11299.aspx" target="_blank">Windows Services</a>) and verify that you can see MySQL
        listed there and that it is running. You may also want to configure it to automatically start whenever your system starts.
      </li>
      <li>You should have established an admin username and password during installation of MySQL. Please save this for future use. Without this
        username and password you can not setup the database in the next step.</li>
      <li>You can access MySQL through your favorite client.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Setup Database</h2>
    <p>Now that MySQL is installed and you have access to your new database, it is time to install the DQA specific database that the DQA will
      need to do its work. This database will also hold the data imported in which you can directly access by connecting to the database using your
      favorite MySQL client.</p>
    <p>
      These instructions require that you connect to your database using your client. The examples given will be shown on the <a
        href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/mysql.html">MySQL Command-Line Tool</a>. Instructions for other clients will vary from these
      instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The MySQL database scripts can be found at <a href="https://svn.code.sf.net/p/ois-dqa/code/database/mysql/trunk/">https://svn.code.sf.net/p/ois-dqa/code/database/mysql/trunk/</a>
      . For this installation you will need the following files:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>create-user.sql</li>
      <li>initial-v1.08.sql</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Download, modify and then run each of these scripts:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Download the two scripts to your local system.</li>
      <li>Open the create-user.sql script in a text editor, such as Notepad, and modify the changme password to a secure password that you will
        remember. This is the username and password you will give to access the DQA when it is running.</li>
      <li>Run the create-user.sql script and verify there are no errors.</li>
      <li>Open the initial-v1.08.sql script and modify line 44 to indicate the user information for the admin user. Change dqa_admin to a user
        name of your choosing, change_this_password to a secure password, and set_this_email@email.com to your email address.</li>
      <li>Run the initial-v1.08.sql script and verify there are no errors.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Note: To run a script into MySQL you can use a command like this:<br />
      <code>mysql -uroot -ppassword &lt; script.sql</code>
      <br /> Make sure
      <code>root</code>
      and
      <code>password</code>
      are replaced with the username and password you created when installing MySQL and the file name
      <code>script.sql</code>
      is replaced with the name of the file you want to import. The -u and -p should remain on front of the username and password.
    </p>


    <h2>Install Java</h2>
    <p>
      Installation instructions for java are maintained by Oracle and can be found here: <a
        href="https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.xml">How do I install Java?</a>. Install the default or latest version pointed to
      by this site.
    </p>
    <h2>Install Tomcat</h2>
    <p>
      Installation instructions for Tomcat are maintained by the Apache Software Foundation here: <a
        href="http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/appdev/installation.html">Installation</a>. Install the Tomcat version 7 or later.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once Tomcat is installed it would normally be configured to run automatically in the services panel, if running on a Windows system. Ensure that
      Tomcat is up and running before downloading the DQA. You can confirm that Tomcat is running by visiting <a href="localhost:8080">localhost:8080</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Download DQA</h2>
    <p>In this last step everything comes together for a working system. You should have Tomcat and MySQL up and running.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Download the software application from the <a href="http://ois-pt.org/tester/installDQA/DownloadServlet"> DQA Download</a> site. Note:
        you will need to enter the URL, username and password to download the software. The URL will probably be: <code>jdbc:mysql://localhost/dqa</code>,
        if the database and Tomcat are installed on the same system. The username and password were set by you in the Setup Database stage. Setting
        these values here allows the downloading software to your database connection parameters in the DQA version you get.
      </li>
      <li>Save the dqa.war file into the Tomcat/webapps directory. In a windows system this can be found here: C:\Program Files\Apache Software
        Foundation\Tomcat 7.0\webapps</li>
      <li>Confirm that after a few seconds Tomcat has created a Tomcat/webapps/dqa directory to match the dqa.war file that you just copied in.
        This indicates that Tomcat is running and was able to unpack the DQA application and deploy it.</li>
      <li>Login to the DQA via your web browser <a href="http://localhost:8080/config"></a>. You will use the password you setup in the Setup
        Database stage.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Configure the DQA</h2>
    <p>Once you have successfully logged in you will want to configure the DQA to start working for you.</p>
