    <h1>Texas Children&#39;s Hospital</h1>
    <p>
      In 2010 Texas Children&#39;s Hospital developed an immunization forecaster for use within their hospital and associated physician&#39;s network.
      The forecaster has been in use for over two years now and continues to be maintained and improved. In 2011, at the 45th National Immunization
      Conference, Nathan Bunker <a href="http://cdc.confex.com/cdc/nic2011/webprogram/Session11615.html">shared details</a> on how this immunization
      forecaster was built. Texas Children&#39;s Hospital is looking for ways to share their knowledge and expertise with the wider community.
    </p>
    <p>Currently the software development efforts of the TCH team are divided into three software applications:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>TCH Forecaster</b>: An immunization decision support API and standalone application. This is the core TCH Forecaster, which can run
        independently or be integrated into an Java application.</li>
      <li><b>TCH Forecast Connector</b>: A small API with support for connecting to various forecasters to provide a common interfacing API.</li>
      <li><b>TCH Forecast Tester</b>: A web system for organizing test cases, expert opinions and comparing these will realtime results from real
        forecasters.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>TCH Forecaster</h2>
